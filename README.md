## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley after completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Economics at Brown University. I've also worked as a project manager across various industries, so I'm confident in my ability to be a translator between business and technical teams. I'm making a career transition, so I'm looking for opportunities to apply what I've learned in school to real-world data and real-world problems.
